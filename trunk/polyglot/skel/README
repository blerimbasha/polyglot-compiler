This directory contains a skeleton for a Polyglot extension.
Run the script ../newext.sh to create a new extension using
this skeleton. 

The skeleton includes its own build.xml file.  Building the
generated extension requires that Polyglot be installed and
in your classpath.  This will be the case if the extension
source directory is polyglot/src/<ext>, parallel to the
polyglot source in polyglot/src/polyglot.  If the extension
is installed elsewhere, either adjust the classpath to include
polyglot.jar, java_cup.jar, and JFlex.jar or add these jar
files to <ext>/lib.
