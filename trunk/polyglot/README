Polyglot 0.9.6

                    Polyglot Extensible Compiler Toolkit
                    ------------------------------------

Since you are reading this file, you have already downloaded and unpacked the
Polyglot distribution.  Your installation directory contains the following
sub-directories:

  - src: the complete source code of Polyglot
  - src/polyglot: the Polyglot base compiler and some simple extensions 
  - src/ppg: the Polyglot parser generator, an extension of Java CUP
  - src/java_cup: tweaked version of the Java CUP parser generator 0.10k.
  - doc: documentation about writing Polyglot extensions
  - doc/api: Javadoc descriptions of Polyglot classes

Disclaimer
----------

Polglot is ALPHA software.  Some of the interfaces in the framework may change.
This may require some extensions to be changed to conform to the new
interfaces.  Also, Polyglot is not well-documented; in particular, some of the
javadoc is missing or out-of-date.  We are working on writing better
documentation.  Watch the web page:

    http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/polyglot

for further updates.  If you use Polyglot, we'd appreciate your letting us
know.  Send your comments and bug reports to Nate Nystrom at
nystrom@cs.cornell.edu.

Requirements
------------

Polyglot builds on Unix and on Windows using the Cygwin environment.  We
recommend that you use JDK 1.3 or later.  We have experienced problems with
versions of the JDK older than 1.3.  You must ensure that java and javac are in
your path.  Polyglot is compiled with the Ant build tool
(http://jakarta.apache.org/ant).  GNU make is used for compiling
and running test cases.  We are phasing out the use of make in favor of Ant.

To build and use Polyglot, you will also need the JFlex scanner generator,
downloadable from:

        http://www.jflex.de

Install JFlex.jar in your classpath or drop it in the lib directory
of the polyglot distribution.

LEGAL NOTE: Polyglot is distributed under LGPL, but JFlex is distributed under
GPL.  This means that we cannot include JFlex in the Polyglot distribution.
The output of JFlex inherits the license of the specification (i.e., LGPL in
Polyglot's case), so using JFlex is not a problem.  You may be able to
substitute JLex (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/), but
this is untested.

Creating an extension
---------------------

To create your own extensions, see the file doc/Overview.txt.

Building Polyglot
-----------------

Polyglot is compiled with the Ant build tool (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant).
Follow these steps to build the base compiler and the installed extensions:

1. First ensure javac is in your path and that you are using JDK 1.3 or later.
Also ensure JFlex.jar is in your classpath or is in the lib directory.

2. Go to the root directory of the Polyglot installation (the directory this
README is in).  We'll call this directory $POLYGLOT from now on.

    $ cd $POLYGLOT

3. Run ant to configure the compiler.

    $ ant configure

This generates the shell script bin/jlc.  Configuration need only be
performed once.

4. Run ant to build the base compiler.

    $ ant

Optionally, create some extensions:

    $ ant coffer pao
  
Class files will be placed in the $POLYGLOT/classes directory.
You may optionally, do:

    $ ant jar
    $ ant coffer-jar pao-jar

to create jar files for Polyglot and for each extension.

5. Update PATH and CLASSPATH.

Add $POLYGLOT/bin to your PATH environment variable.

Update your CLASSPATH environment variable.  On Unix, do:

    $ CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$POLYGLOT/classes:$POLYGLOT/java_cup.jar

On Windows, do:

    $ set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;$POLYGLOT\classes;$POLYGLOT\java_cup.jar

If you created jar files, adjust the classpath accordingly.

6. You are now ready to try out Polyglot.  See doc/Overview.txt for
instructions on building an extension.  To compile using an existing
extension do:

    $ jlc -ext <extname> <source-file>

For example:

    $ jlc -ext pao src/polyglot/ext/pao/tests/Test.pao

or equivalently:

    $ jlc -extclass polyglot.ext.pao.ExtensionInfo \
        src/polyglot/ext/pao/tests/Test.pao

The latter usage is convenient if the extension is not implemented as
a subpackage in the polyglot source tree.

To compile using the base compiler, just leave out the -ext option:

    $ jlc File.jl

This should produce a file called File.java that is almost identical to
File.jl.

from the BLOAT bytecode optimizer written by Nathaniel Nystrom, David Whitlock,
and Antony Hosking at Purdue.  See http://www.cs.purdue.edu/s3/projects/bloat/.
