Polyglot 0.9.2

                    Polyglot Extensible Compiler Toolkit
                    ------------------------------------

Since you are reading this file, you have already downloaded and unpacked the
Polyglot distribution.  Your installation directory contains the following
sub-directories:

  - polyglot: the complete source code of Polyglot 0.9
  - doc: old documentation about writing Polyglot extensions
  - javadoc: Javadoc descriptions of Polyglot classes
  - images: Logos


Disclaimer
----------

Polglot is ALPHA software.  Some of the interfaces in the framework may change.
This may require some extensions to be changed to conform to the new
interfaces.  Also, Polyglot is not well-documented; in particular, some of the
javadoc is missing or out-of-date.  We are working on writing better
documentation.  Watch the web page:

    http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/polyglot

for further updates.  If you use Polyglot, we'd appreciate your letting us
know.  Send your comments and bug reports to Nate Nystrom at
nystrom@cs.cornell.edu.


Requirements
------------

Polyglot builds on Unix and on Windows using the Cygwin environment.  We
recommend that you use JDK 1.3 or later.  We have experienced problems with
versions of the JDK older than 1.3.  You must ensure that java and javac are in
your path.

Creating an extension
---------------------

To create your own extensions, see the file doc/Overview.txt.

Building Polyglot
-----------------

Follow the following steps to build the base compiler and the installed
extensions.

1. First ensure javac is in your path and that you are using JDK 1.3 or later.
Suppose the root directory of the Polyglot installation (the directory this
README is in) is $POLYGLOT.

2. Configure the build environment.

On Unix, do:

    $ sh ./configure

On Windows NT, you will need the Cygwin environment.  While running sh, do:

    $ sh ./configure

This script will locate java and javac and determine the values of some
Java properties.  The script will create Defs.mk and bin/defs.

Running configure with no options will create a Defs.mk file for building all
installed language extensions.  You may optionally specify on the command line,
the names of the extensions to build.  The installed extensions can be found in
the directory polyglot/ext

3. Run make:

    $ make

Class files will be dumped in the $POLYGLOT/classes directory.
You may optionally:

    $ make jar

to create jar files for polyglot and each extension.

4. Update PATH and CLASSPATH.

Add $POLYGLOT/bin to your PATH environment variable.

Update your CLASSPATH environment variable.  On Unix, do:

    $ CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$POLYGLOT/classes:$POLYGLOT/java_cup.jar

On Windows, do:

    $ set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;$POLYGLOT\classes;$POLYGLOT\java_cup.jar

If you created jar files, adjust the classpath accordingly.

4. You are now ready to try out Polyglot.  See doc/Overview.txt for
instructions on building an extension.  To compile using an existing
extension do:

    $ jlc -ext <extname> File.jl

To compile using the base compiler:

    $ jlc File.jl
