Installation Instructions
--------------------------

First ensure javac is in your path and that you are using JDK 1.2
or later.

1. Create "bin" directory and running scripts.

On Unix, do:

    sh ./configure

On Windows NT, you will need the Cygwin environment. While running sh, do:

    sh ./configure

2. Update PATH and CLASSPATH.

Suppose <jltools> is the absolute path of your JLtools installation directory.

-- Add "<jltools>/bin" to your PATH environment variable or copy all the files
in "<jltools>/bin" to a directory in PATH.

-- Check your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable on Unix systems, and your
PATH environment variable on Windows systems. Make sure the value contains
<jltools>/lib.

-- Update your CLASSPATH environment variable.

On Unix, do:

    CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:<jltools>/lib/jltools.jar:<jltools>/lib/jif.jar:<jltools>/lib/java_cup.jar

On Windows, do:

    set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;<jltools>\lib\jltools.jar;<jltools>\lib\jif.jar;<jltools>\lib\java_cup.jar

3. Test Jif compiler

First, you need to create some principals. In Jif, principals are represented
by classes in the jif.principal package. Suppose <foo> is the directory you
like to put the jif.principal package in, run:

    ./bin/sampleusers <foo>
    ./bin/localusers <foo>

"sampleusers" is a utility to create some sample principals like Alice and
Bob. "localusers" will generate Jif principals for users on your local
machine. Make sure that <foo> is in your CLASSPATH environment variable.

Go to the demo directory, run:

    jif Hello.jif
    java Hello

If you see "Hello, the world!" printed on the screen, you have successfully
installed JLtools. Otherwise, make sure that you have followed every
instruction in step 1 and 2. If you still cannot run the Hello demo, please
contact the authors.
