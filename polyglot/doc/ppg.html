<a name="what"><h3>What is JLgen?</h3></a>
JLgen provides the ability of extending languages by inheriting
grammars, thus simplifying language grammar management, revision, and
modifying base grammars automatically extends modifications to all
inherting grammars, so changes are localized.

<a name="usage"><h3>Using JLgen</h3></a>
A JLgen file differs from a CUP grammar in several key ways:
<ol>
  <li>The first line of a JLgen file is
    <ul><tt><b>include &quot;</b><i>filename</i><b>&quot;</b></tt></ul>
    A JLgen file can include a CUP spec or another JLgen file.
  <li>A JLgen grammar specification can modify the results of its
    inheritance using the following commands:
  <ul>
    <li><tt><b>drop {</b></tt> <i>symbol</i> <tt><b>}</b></tt><br>
      where <i>symbol</i> is an <u>inherited</u> terminal or
      nonterminal.<br> Result: symbol is removed from grammar, and
      if a nonterminal, all productions where it is on the
      <b>left-hand side</b> are also eliminated. It is up to the user
      to drop productions where this symbol appears on the right hand side.
    <li><tt><b>drop {</b></tt> <i>S</i> <tt><b>::=</b></tt> &lt;
      <i>productions</i>&gt; <tt><b>; }</b></tt><br>
      where <i>S</i> is an <u>inherited</u> nonterminal, productions
      are inherited productions of S present before evaluation of the
      current JLgen file, terminated with a semicolon.<br>
      Result: only these productions are removed from the specified
      nonterminal, the nonterminal remains, even if ALL of its
      productions are dropped in this way. To get rid of the symbol
      entirely, use the syntax above.
    <li><tt><b>override</b></tt> - FIXME
    <li><tt><b>extend</b></tt> - FIXME
    <li><tt><b>transfer</b></tt> - FIXME
    <li>Adding productions: same syntax as in CUP.
  </ul>
</ol>


Syntax for invocation of JLgen is simply<br>
<ul><tt><b>jlgen &lt;grammar file&gt;</b></tt></ul>
for either a standard CUP file or for a JLgen-based grammar
inheritance file.<p>

In the case of inherited grammars, file inclusion is treated as
relative to where the base file is located.
