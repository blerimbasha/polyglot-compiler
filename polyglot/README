Polyglot 0.9.6

                    Polyglot Extensible Compiler Toolkit
                    ------------------------------------

Since you are reading this file, you have already downloaded and unpacked the
Polyglot distribution.  Your installation directory contains the following
sub-directories:

  - src: the complete source code of Polyglot
  - src/polyglot: the Polyglot base compiler and some simple extensions 
  - src/ppg: the Polyglot parser generator, an extension of Java CUP
  - src/java_cup: tweaked version of the Java CUP parser generator 0.10k.
  - doc: documentation about writing Polyglot extensions
  - doc/api: Javadoc descriptions of Polyglot classes

Disclaimer
----------

Polglot is ALPHA software.  Some of the interfaces in the framework may change.
This may require some extensions to be changed to conform to the new
interfaces.  Also, Polyglot is not well-documented; in particular, some of the
javadoc is missing or out-of-date.  We are working on writing better
documentation.  Watch the web page:

    http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/polyglot

for further updates.  If you use Polyglot, we'd appreciate your letting us
know.  Send your comments and bug reports to Nate Nystrom at
nystrom@cs.cornell.edu.


Requirements
------------

Polyglot builds on Unix and on Windows using the Cygwin environment.  We
recommend that you use JDK 1.3 or later.  We have experienced problems with
versions of the JDK older than 1.3.  You must ensure that java and javac are in
your path.  Polyglot is compiled with the Ant build tool
(http://jakarta.apache.org/ant).  GNU make is used for compiling
and running test cases.  We are phasing out the use of make in favor of Ant.

Creating an extension
---------------------

To create your own extensions, see the file doc/Overview.txt.

Building Polyglot
-----------------

Polyglot is compiled with the Ant build tool (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant).
Follow these steps to build the base compiler and the installed extensions:

1. First ensure javac is in your path and that you are using JDK 1.3 or later.

2. Assume the root directory of the Polyglot installation (the directory this
README is in) is $POLYGLOT.

    $ cd $POLYGLOT

3. Run ant to build the base compiler (the "jl" target).

    $ ant jl

Optionally, create some extensions:

    $ ant coffer pao
  
Class files will be placed in the $POLYGLOT/classes directory.
You may optionally, do:

    $ ant jar
    $ ant coffer-jar pao-jar

to create jar files for Polyglot and for each extension.

4. Update PATH and CLASSPATH.

Add $POLYGLOT/bin to your PATH environment variable.

Update your CLASSPATH environment variable.  On Unix, do:

    $ CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$POLYGLOT/classes:$POLYGLOT/java_cup.jar

On Windows, do:

    $ set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;$POLYGLOT\classes;$POLYGLOT\java_cup.jar

If you created jar files, adjust the classpath accordingly.

5. You are now ready to try out Polyglot.  See doc/Overview.txt for
instructions on building an extension.  To compile using an existing
extension do:

    $ jlc -ext <extname> File.jl

To compile using the base compiler:

    $ jlc File.jl
